            Hello, my name is Aryan and I am a first-year student studying computer science.
            I'm fascinated by the potential of machine learning to address global challenges, 
            such as predicting natural disasters and how it can improve access to education. In my free time, 
            I like to hang out with my friends and watch sports. I also like to play tennis and pickelball.
